# Trojan-Tracker

This project is used to analyze files and detect malicious software hidden in the file.

This program uses modern technologies to analyze the file from the level of detecting encryption,
to the level of the commands that exist in it, and running it against dozens of different antiviruses.

Finally, you will receive a detailed report with the program's findings, and a heuristic estimate of the probability that the file is indeed infected.
